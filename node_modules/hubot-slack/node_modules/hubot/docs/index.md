## Getting Started With Hubot

You will need [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). Once those are installed, we can install the imubot generator:

    %  npm install -g yo generator-imubot

This will give us the `imubot` [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator. Now we
can make a new directory, and generate a new instance of imubot in it. For example, if
we wanted to make a bot called myimubot:


    % mkdir myimubot
    % cd myimubot
    % yo imubot

At this point, you'll be asked a few questions about who is creating the bot,
and which [adapter](/docs/adapters.md) you'll be using. Adapters are imubot's
way of integrating with different chat providers.

If you are using git, the generated directory includes a .gitignore, so you can
initialize and add everything:

    % git init
    % git add .
    % git commit -m "Initial commit"

If you'd prefer to automate your imubot build without being interactively
prompted for its configuration, you can add the following options
to the `yo imubot` command to do so:

| Option                                      | Description
| ------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------
| `--owner="Bot Wrangler <bw@example.com>"`   | Bot owner, e.g. "Bot Wrangler <bw@example.com>"
| `--name="Hubot"`                            | Bot name, e.g. "Hubot"
| `--description="Delightfully aware robutt"` | Bot description, e.g. "Delightfully aware robutt"
| `--adapter=campfire`                        | Bot adapter, e.g. "campfire"
| `--defaults`                                | Declare all defaults are set and no prompting required

You now have your own functional imubot! There's a `bin/imubot`
command for convenience, to handle installing npm dependencies, loading scripts,
and then launching your imubot.

Hubot needs Redis to persist data, so before you can start imubot on your own computer, you should have Redis installed on your localhost. If just want to test Hubot without Redis, then you can remove `imubot-redis-brain` from `external-scripts.json`.

    % bin/imubot
    Hubot>

This starts imubot using the [shell adapter](/docs/adapters/shell.md), which
is mostly useful for development. Make note of  `Hubot>`; this is the name your imubot will
`respond` to with commands. For example, to list available commands:

    % bin/imubot
    imubot> imubot help
    imubot adapter - Reply with the adapter
    imubot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few parameters to try to return an animated GIF instead.
    imubot echo <text> - Reply back with <text>
    imubot help - Displays all of the help commands that imubot knows about.
    imubot help <query> - Displays all help commands that match <query>.
    imubot image me <query> - The Original. Queries Google Images for <query> and returns a random top result.
    imubot map me <query> - Returns a map view of the area returned by `query`.
    imubot mustache me <query> - Searches Google Images for the specified query and mustaches it.
    imubot mustache me <url> - Adds a mustache to the specified URL.
    imubot ping - Reply with pong
    imubot pronounce <phrase> in <language> - Provides pronunciation of <phrase> (<language> is optional)
    imubot pug bomb N - get N pugs
    imubot pug me - Receive a pug
    imubot the rules - Make sure imubot still knows the rules.
    imubot time - Reply with current time
    imubot translate me <phrase> - Searches for a translation for the <phrase> and then prints that bad boy out.
    imubot translate me from <source> into <target> <phrase> - Translates <phrase> from <source> into <target>. Both <source> and <target> are optional
    imubot youtube me <query> - Searches YouTube for the query and returns the video embed link.
    ship it - Display a motivation squirrel

You almost definitely will want to change your imubot's name to add character. bin/imubot takes a `--name`:

    % bin/imubot --name myimubot
    myimubot>

Your imubot will now respond as `myimubot`. This is
case-insensitive, and can be prefixed with `@` or suffixed with `:`. These are equivalent:

    MYMUBOT help
    myimubot help
    @myimubot help
    myimubot: help

## Scripts

Hubot's power comes through scripts. There are hundreds of scripts written and maintained by the community. Find them by searching the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/imubot-scripts) for `imubot-scripts <your-search-term>`. For example:

```
$ npm search imubot-scripts github
NAME                  DESCRIPTION
imubot-deployer        Giving Hubot the ability to deploy GitHub repos to PaaS providers imubot imubot-scripts imubot-gith
imubot-gh-release-pr   A imubot script to create GitHub's PR for release
imubot-github          Giving Hubot the ability to be a vital member of your github organization
â€¦
```

To use a script from an NPM package:

1. Run `npm install --save <package-name>` to add the package as a dependency and install it.
2. Add the package to `external-scripts.json`.
3. Run `npm home <package-name>` to open a browser window for the homepage of the script, where you can find more information about configuring and installing the script.

You can also put your own scripts under the `scripts/` directory. All scripts placed there are automatically loaded and ready to use with your imubot. Read more about customizing imubot by [writing your own scripts](/docs/scripting.md).

## Adapters

Hubot uses the adapter pattern to support multiple chat-backends. Here is a [list of available adapters](/docs/adapters.md), along with details on how to configure them.

## Deploying

You can deploy imubot to Heroku, which is the officially supported method.
Additionally you are able to deploy imubot to a UNIX-like system or Windows.
Please note the support for deploying to Windows isn't officially supported.

* [Deploying Hubot onto UNIX](/docs/deploying/unix.md)
* [Deploying Hubot onto Windows](/docs/deploying/windows.md)

## Patterns

Using custom scripts, you can quickly customize Hubot to be the most life embettering bot he or she can be. Read [docs/patterns.md](/docs/patterns.md) for some nifty tricks that may come in handy as you teach your imubot new skills.
